# barplotUtils
Small individual project consisting of simple bar plotting utilities.
The point of barplotUtils is to provide simple and intuitive methods for
quickly plotting bar plots without losing the versitility provided by the
matplotlib library (which this project is based in).

Features:
- broadcasting kwargs, all methods implement this, this allows a high degree of customisation for plots.
- barplotUtils.stackbar, intuitive stack bar plots with little effort.
- barplotUtils.multibar, simple multiple bar plots.
